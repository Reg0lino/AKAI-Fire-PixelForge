## üéõÔ∏è Overview

**Akai Fire PixelForge** (developed by Reg0lino & Gemini AI) is a Python desktop application designed to provide comprehensive control over an Akai Fire MIDI controller. It allows users to customize its 4x16 RGB pad matrix with static color layouts and frame-by-frame animations, and dynamically reflect desktop colors onto the pads using a screen sampler. Critically, it now offers advanced customization of the Akai Fire's 128x64 monochrome OLED display. The application features a modern, dark-themed, and intuitive user interface built with PyQt6.

This project aims to unlock the full visual potential of the Akai Fire, transforming it from just a MIDI controller into a versatile lighting instrument and a rich visual feedback tool, especially through its newly enhanced OLED capabilities.

## ‚ú® Features

*   **Direct Pad/Button Painting:** Easily paint individual pads with a chosen color using a smooth, canvas-like drag interface (left-click to paint, right-click to erase).
*   **Sophisticated Color Picker:** Includes SV (Saturation/Value) map, Hue slider, RGB/Hex inputs, and "My Colors" swatches for saving favorite colors (right-click swatches for options).
*   **Static Color Layouts:** Create, save, load, and manage static color presets for the entire 4x16 pad grid.
*   **Frame-by-Frame Pad Animation Sequencer ("Animator Studio"):**

    *   Visual timeline for arranging frames (supports multi-selection).
    *   Add (snapshot/blank), delete, duplicate, copy, cut, and paste frames.
    *   **Improved Undo/Redo:** Undo functionality now operates on a "per paint stroke" basis for smoother drawing performance, while still supporting undo for other major actions.
    *   Control animation speed (FPS) and looping.
    *   Integrated sequence file management: Save, load, create new, and delete animation sequences.
    *   **Performance Note:** Pad drawing responsiveness in the Animator is significantly improved.
*   **Interactive Screen Sampler ("Ambient Mode"):**
    *   Visually select a region on any connected monitor.
    *   Dropdown to select the target monitor for sampling.
    *   Live preview of the sampled region within the configuration dialog.
    *   Adjust Saturation, Contrast, Brightness, and Hue Shift for the sampled colors (settings saved per monitor).
    *   Colors from the screen region are reflected onto the Akai Fire pads.
*   **Sampler Recording:** Record sampler output as new animation sequences.
*   **Advanced OLED Display Customization (New & Enhanced!):**

    *   **OLED Content Library Manager:** Create, edit, manage, and save custom "Text Items" and "Image Animation Items" (from static images or GIFs) as JSON presets. Includes live previews and a "Save & Apply" feature. Single-frame image items are now distinctly labeled "(Image)".
    *   **Custom Text Items:** Define text, select system fonts, set size, alignment, and scrolling behavior (with speed/pause overrides).
    *   **Custom Image & GIF Animations:** Import images/GIFs with processing options (resize, contrast, invert, multiple dithering algorithms like Floyd-Steinberg, Threshold, Bayer). Set playback FPS and loop behavior.
    *   **"Active Graphic" System:** Designate any custom item as your persistent default OLED display after the built-in startup visual.
    *   **Manual Play/Pause for OLED Active Graphic:** A new clickable icon on the main UI allows users to manually pause/resume the OLED's Active Graphic. This can be useful for performance if the OLED animation (especially high FPS) impacts other interactions like pad animator drawing.
    *   **Temporary System Messages:** Clear, large "TomThumb" font feedback for hardware actions and status updates, gracefully reverting to the Active Graphic.
    *   **Application Default Message:** A default scrolling message if no Active Graphic is set.
*   **Hardware Integration & Contextual Control:**
    *   MIDI connection with port selection and auto-detection.
    *   **Dynamic Knob Control:** Top hardware knobs adapt to control Global Pad Brightness, Sampler Parameters (Brightness, Saturation, Contrast, Hue), or Animator Speed.
    *   **OLED Feedback:** Real-time feedback for knob turns and system events on the OLED.
    *   **Hardware Button Mapping:** BROWSER/PERFORM for sampler toggle; DRUM for monitor cycle; GRID L/R & SELECT Encoder for UI list navigation; PATTERN UP/DOWN & BROWSER for OLED item cueing/activation.
*   **Modern UI & Persistent Settings:** Dark-themed PyQt6 interface, QSS styling. User settings (color swatches, sampler prefs, OLED config) saved.
*   **Global Hotkeys:** For common animator operations.
