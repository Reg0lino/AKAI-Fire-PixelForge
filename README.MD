## üéõÔ∏è Overview

**Akai Fire PixelForge v1.0.0** (developed by Reg0lino & Gemini AI) is a Python desktop application providing comprehensive control over an Akai Fire MIDI controller. It allows users to customize its 4x16 RGB pad matrix with static color layouts and frame-by-frame animations, and dynamically reflect desktop colors onto the pads using a screen sampler. A cornerstone of this release is the **vastly enhanced customization of the Akai Fire's 128x64 monochrome OLED display**, featuring a rich library system, advanced image processing (including new dithering algorithms, gamma, blur, sharpen, noise injection), and now, the ability to **play the "LazyDOOM" retro FPS directly on the OLED!**

This project transforms the Akai Fire into a versatile lighting instrument, a rich visual feedback tool, and even a mini retro gaming console.

## üéÆ Usage

1.  Launch, connect to Akai Fire (ports should auto-select). OLED shows startup, then Active Graphic.
2.  **OLED Customization:** Click the on-screen OLED mirror. Create/edit Text or Image/GIF items.
    *   Explore the "Import & Processing Options": Try different **Monochrome** dithering algorithms, adjust **Brightness**, **Contrast**, **Gamma**, **Sharpening**, **Dither Strength**, **Pre-Dither Blur**, and **Noise Injection**.
    *   Use "Set as Active Graphic" or "Save & Apply". Manually pause/play OLED via icon.
3.  **Pad Control:** Use Color Picker, Static Layouts, or Animator Studio.
4.  **Screen Sampler:** Toggle via UI/hardware. Configure region/adjustments. Record.
5.  **LazyDOOM:** Click the "üëπ LazyDOOM" button on the right panel. Follow instructions.
6.  **Hardware Controls:** Utilize top knobs and buttons for context-sensitive control.

## üìù Future Ideas

*   Cross-platform packaging (macOS, Linux).
*   More advanced animation features (e.g., easing, layer blending).
*   Further LazyDOOM enhancements (more enemy types, pickups, sound).
