## üéõÔ∏è Overview

**Akai Fire PixelForge v1.7.0** (developed by Reg0lino & Gemini AI) is a powerful desktop application that transforms the Akai Fire controller from a dedicated FL Studio accessory into a versatile, standalone instrument for visual and creative expression.

This project allows users to paint on the 4x16 RGB pads, create complex frame-by-frame animations, mirror desktop colors for ambient lighting, and drive a powerful real-time audio visualizer. A cornerstone of the project is the enhanced customization of the 128x64 OLED display, featuring a rich library system, advanced image processing, and the ability to **play the "LazyDOOM" retro FPS directly on the OLED!**

This application turns the Akai Fire into a dynamic lighting instrument, a rich visual feedback tool, and a mini retro gaming console, all driven by a stable, professional-grade user interface.

## ‚ú® Features (v1.7.0)

*   **üé® NEW: Full UI Overhaul & Color Grading System!**
    *   **Universal Color Grading / Live FX:** A new panel provides real-time, non-destructive control over **Brightness, Saturation, Contrast, and Hue** for all visual output.
    *   **"Bake In" Effects:** Permanently apply the current FX settings to selected animator frames, complete with full Undo/Redo support.
    *   **Redesigned Layout:** The entire application has been re-architected for a more logical and scalable workflow, with a new full-featured menu bar.

*   **üéµ Advanced Audio Visualizer**
    *   Turns system audio into a real-time light show on the pads.
    *   **Three Modes:** "Classic Spectrum Bars", "Pulse Wave", or the comprehensive "Dual VU + Spectrum".
    *   **Live Settings:** A detailed settings dialog allows for real-time tweaking of colors, sensitivity, smoothness, and more while the visualizer is running.
    *   Includes a robust preset system for saving and loading custom palettes and schemes.

*   **Interactive Screen Sampler ("Ambient Mode")**
    *   Visually select screen regions and mirror them onto the pads.

*   **Full Hardware Integration & Revamped UI**
    *   **Smart, Context-Aware Knobs:** The top-strip knobs automatically control Global Brightness, Sampler Parameters, or Animator Speed depending on the active mode.
    *   **Complete Button Mapping:** All major features, including mode-switching (Sampler/Visualizer) and FX toggling, are mapped to physical hardware buttons for a screen-free workflow.
    *   **Real-time OLED Feedback:** The OLED provides instant feedback for knob turns, mode changes, and other system events.
