## üéõÔ∏è Overview

**Akai Fire PixelForge v1.5.0** (developed by Reg0lino & Gemini AI) is a Python desktop application that transforms the Akai Fire controller into a versatile creative tool. It allows users to paint on the 4x16 RGB pads, create frame-by-frame animations, mirror desktop colors, and now, drive a powerful **real-time audio visualizer**. A cornerstone of the project is the enhanced customization of the 128x64 OLED display, featuring a rich library system, advanced image processing, and the ability to **play the "LazyDOOM" retro FPS directly on the OLED!**

This project turns the Akai Fire into a dynamic lighting instrument, a rich visual feedback tool, and even a mini retro gaming console.
