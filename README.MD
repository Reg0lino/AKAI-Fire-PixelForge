## üéõÔ∏è Overview

**PixelForge for Akai Fire v2.0.0** (developed by Reg0lino & Gemini AI) is a powerful desktop application that transforms the Akai Fire controller from a dedicated FL Studio accessory into a versatile, standalone instrument for visual and creative expression.

This project allows users to paint on the 4x16 RGB pads, create complex frame-by-frame animations, mirror desktop colors for ambient lighting, and drive a powerful real-time audio visualizer. This version introduces a powerful **GIF Importer**, allowing you to create stunning animations from existing files on your computer or the web. A cornerstone of the project is the enhanced customization of the 128x64 OLED display, featuring a rich library system, advanced image processing, and the ability to **play the "LazyDOOM" retro FPS directly on the OLED!**

This application turns the Akai Fire into a dynamic lighting instrument, a rich visual feedback tool, and a mini retro gaming console, all driven by a stable, professional-grade user interface.

## ‚ú® Features (v2.0.0)
