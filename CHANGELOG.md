# Changelog - PixelForge for Akai Fire

## [Version 2.1.0] - August 2, 2025

This is a critical quality-of-life and stability release that resolves a long-standing bug preventing real-time animation speed control. The core logic for how the animator panel interacts with the main window and hardware has been refactored to be more robust, responsive, and intuitive, perfecting the workflow introduced in v2.0.0.

### ‚ú® **NEW FEATURES & ENHANCEMENTS**

*   **Animator Workflow & Usability Enhancements:**
    *   The on-screen **`Speed` slider** in the Animator Studio is now **fully interactive and unlocked** during animation playback, allowing for real-time speed adjustments with the mouse.
    *   The physical `SELECT` knob's on-screen label now correctly and instantly changes from `Select` to **`Speed`** the moment playback begins.
    *   The knob's visual indicator now correctly initializes to the current animation speed, preventing the "snapping" effect on the first turn.
    *   The physical knob now provides correct, real-time FPS feedback on the OLED display during playback.

### üêõ **BUG FIXES & STABILITY**

*   **CRITICAL: Fixed Animator Speed Control Regression:**
    *   Resolved a deep-seated architectural flaw where the main window's global UI update would incorrectly override the animator's local UI state during playback.
    *   Fixed a broken signal connection between the `SequenceModel` and the `AnimatorManagerWidget`, which was the root cause of the UI failing to update automatically on playback state changes.
    *   Refactored the animator's UI update logic into a direct, brute-force call chain, bypassing the failing signal/slot system and ensuring the UI state is always correct and responsive.
*   **Fixed Conflicting Hardware Feedback:**
    *   Resolved an issue where turning the `SELECT` knob during playback would incorrectly display "idle" navigation feedback (the sequence name) on the OLED screen. It now correctly displays the current animation FPS.

*   **CRITICAL: Cross-Feature Stability (Sampler/Visualizer):**
    *   Fixed all `AttributeError` and `TypeError` crashes that occurred when trying to enable one master feature (like the Audio Visualizer) while another (like the Screen Sampler) was running.
    *   The application now intelligently and seamlessly handles switching between these modes from either the GUI or hardware buttons without crashing.

*   **Fixed Hardware Control Regressions:**
    *   Restored full functionality to the `SELECT` encoder for navigating and loading animator sequences and layouts.
    *   Fixed the OLED "SAVE?" cue, which now reliably appears on the hardware display when loading a sequence with unsaved changes via the `SELECT` encoder.
    *   Restored missing OLED feedback for all top-row knob adjustments, providing clear visual confirmation of value changes.
    *   Tuned the sensitivity of the sampler adjustment knobs to be less "laggy" and prevent overshooting, resulting in a much more precise and responsive feel.

*   **Fixed UI & Dialog Bugs:**
    *   Resolved `NameError` and `SyntaxError` crashes in the `AppGuideDialog`, making it fully functional.
    *   Corrected the vertical alignment of non-scrolling text on the OLED display, preventing it from being cut off at the top.
    *   Fixed highlight colors in the App Guide's text to match the application's aesthetic.

## [Version 1.6.0] - UI & FX Overhaul 

This is a landmark release focused on a massive professional-grade overhaul of the application's user interface, user experience, and creative capabilities. The entire application layout has been re-architected for a more logical, clean, and scalable workflow. This version introduces a powerful, non-destructive "Color Grading / FX" system, a fully-featured menu bar, and a cascade of stability fixes that solidify the entire application.

### ‚ú® **NEW FEATURES & ENHANCEMENTS**

*   **NEW: Universal Color Grading / Live FX System:**
    *   A new "üé® Color Grading / FX" panel has been added, replacing the old "Global Controls" widget.
    *   This panel provides real-time, non-destructive control over **Brightness, Saturation, Contrast, and Hue**.
    *   **Universal Filter:** When enabled, these effects apply globally to all visual output on the hardware, including static layouts, individually painted pads, and animator playback.
    *   **"Apply to Selected Frames" Action:** A new button allows users to permanently "bake in" the current FX settings to selected animator frames. This action shows a confirmation dialog and is fully integrated with the existing **Undo/Redo system**.
    *   **Intelligent Knob Control:** The top-strip knobs automatically sync with and control the FX sliders.

*   **NEW: Full-Featured Application Menu Bar:**
    *   A professional menu bar (`File`, `Edit`, `Animation`, `Tools`, `Help`) has been added to the top of the window, providing a logical home for every application feature.
    *   **New File Operations:** Includes actions for "üìÇ Load Sequence..." from a file dialog and a placeholder for "‚¨áÔ∏è Export Animation as GIF...".
    *   **Reorganized Edit/Animation Menus:** "Edit" now handles universal actions like Undo/Redo, while a new dedicated "Animation" menu contains all frame-specific operations (Cut, Copy, Paste, Duplicate, etc.).
    *   **Tools Menu:** Provides direct access to toggle or configure all major features: Screen Sampler, Audio Visualizer, OLED Customizer, and LazyDOOM.
    *   **Help Menu:** Includes an "About" dialog and a link to the project's GitHub page.

*   **NEW: Enhanced Hardware Workflow & Feedback:**
    *   **Context-Aware "Select/Speed" Knob:** The fifth knob now intelligently switches function. In the animator, it controls list navigation when idle, but automatically becomes a **Speed** controller with full visual feedback during playback.
    *   **OLED "SAVE?" Cue:** When a user tries to load a new sequence via the hardware knob while having unsaved changes, the OLED now displays a "SAVE?" message, directing them to the confirmation dialog on the main screen.

*   **NEW: Default Animator State on Connect:**
    *   Upon connecting the device, the animator now automatically creates and selects a single, blank frame. This provides a ready-to-use "canvas" and fixes numerous bugs related to starting with an empty state (e.g., non-functional Undo, FX, and painting).
    *   **Intelligent Save Prompt:** The "Unsaved Changes" dialog will no longer appear for this initial, untouched blank frame, providing a smoother startup experience.

### üé® **UI/UX REDESIGN & POLISH**

*   **Major Layout Overhaul:**
    *   The main window has been restructured. The `Animator Studio` is now the primary expanding widget, ensuring maximum space for timeline editing.
    *   A new "Control Deck" at the bottom of the left panel now logically groups the `Screen Sampler` and `LazyDOOM` widgets.
*   **Color Grading / FX Panel Refinement:**
    *   The panel layout has been redesigned into a compact 2x2 grid to maximize slider length and provide a professional, clean appearance.
    *   Includes a single "‚ü≥ All" master reset button for convenience.
*   **Top-Strip Device Controls Polish:**
    *   The labels for the four main knobs now display the full words ("Brightness", "Saturation", etc.) for improved clarity.
*   **Menu Bar Styling:** The menu bar and its dropdowns are now fully custom-styled to match the application's dark theme, with proper hover and selection highlights for an intuitive, professional feel.

### üêõ **BUG FIXES & STABILITY**

*   **Fixed All Knob Control & Sync Bugs:**
    *   Completely resolved the logical feedback loop that caused knobs to feel "dead" or unresponsive.
    *   Fixed the visual synchronization of the Speed knob, which now correctly snaps to the animation's current FPS and updates in real-time.
    *   Fixed the initial startup position of the four main knobs, which now correctly default to their centered, neutral position.
    *   Fixed the Select knob press action, which is now correctly ignored during animation playback.
*   **Fixed Animator Selection & UI Bugs:**
    *   Resolved the critical bug that prevented drag-selection in the animator timeline from working correctly in all directions.
    *   Fixed the infinite-loop crash caused by the "Unsaved Changes" dialog re-appearing when loading a new sequence.
*   **Fixed "Black vs. Grey" Pad Color:**
    *   Corrected the pad drawing logic to ensure that pads with a black color (`#000000`) are rendered as true black on the GUI, not dark grey.
*   **Fixed Cross-Feature Crashes:**
    *   Resolved multiple `AttributeError` and `TypeError` crashes that occurred when trying to enable one master feature (like the Audio Visualizer) while another (like the Screen Sampler) was running. The new state management system now correctly grays out and disables conflicting actions.
*   **Architectural Refactoring:**
    *   Completely refactored the `ScreenSamplerManager` and its UI components to resolve a critical startup crash caused by an initialization paradox. This has made the entire feature stable and robust.
