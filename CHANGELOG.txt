# Changelog - Akai Fire PixelForge

## [Version 1.5.0] - June 17, 2025

This major release completes the powerful Audio Visualizer feature, overhauls the Color Picker with a professional primary/secondary color system, and introduces a significant UI/UX redesign of core components like the top "Device Controls" strip. This version represents a substantial leap forward in both creative features and application stability.

### ‚ú® NEW FEATURES & ENHANCEMENTS

*   **Advanced Audio Visualizer (Feature Complete):**
    *   **"Dual VU + Spectrum" Mode:** The final visualizer mode is now fully implemented. It features two VU meters on the sides and a central 5-band audio spectrum, each with its own independent settings for colors, sensitivity, and smoothing.
    *   **"Pulse Wave" Mode Enhancement:** The visualization has been visually enhanced with a soft "fade" effect on adjacent columns for a smoother look.
    *   **Expanded Prefab Palettes:** Added 8 new creative, built-in color palettes for the "Classic Spectrum Bars" mode, including "DOOM Inferno", "Matrix Code", and "Cyberpunk Neon".
    *   **Live Settings:** The `Setup...` dialog can now be opened while the visualizer is running, allowing for real-time tweaking of all parameters.

*   **Color Picker Overhaul (Primary/Secondary Colors):**
    *   The painting workflow has been upgraded to a professional **Primary (Left-Click)** and **Secondary (Right-Click)** color system.
    *   The Color Picker UI has been redesigned with a new interactive color well to show and select the active color, and a `‚áÑ` button to instantly swap them.
    *   The overall layout of the widget has been significantly improved for a more compact, logical, and polished appearance.

*   **Main Window UI/UX Overhaul:**
    *   **"Device Controls" Strip Redesign:** The entire top strip has been rebuilt for a professional look and stability using custom-rendered knob widgets that are immune to system style changes.
    *   **Global Controls Panel:** Added a new `QGroupBox` on the right-hand panel with a dedicated `QSlider` for "Global Pad Brightness," which is perfectly synced with the physical hardware knob.
    *   **Enhanced User Feedback:** Implemented dynamic tooltips for hardware knobs that update with their current function and value.

### üêõ BUG FIXES & STABILITY

*   **Fixed All Knob-Related Crashes and Bugs:** Systematically eliminated a cascade of crashes that occurred when interacting with the top-strip knobs. Resolved logic flaws that caused spurious OLED feedback and prevented GUI interaction.
*   **Fixed Color Picker Functionality:**
    *   Resolved a critical bug where the color picker UI (SV-picker, sliders, input fields) would not update in real-time as a color was being changed.
    *   Fixed an issue where moving the SV-picker would incorrectly cause the Hue slider to flicker or jump ("cross-talk").
    *   Corrected tooltip styling to ensure consistent, readable tooltips for all color picker elements, especially the swap button and color swatches.
*   **Fixed `VisualizerSettingsDialog` Bugs:** Resolved issues with preset management and initialization crashes in the audio visualizer settings.
*   **Fixed `MainWindow` Layout & Initialization:** Resolved multiple critical layout bugs and `AttributeError` crashes during application startup.

    *   **Main Application Integration:** `AudioVisualizerUIManager` added to the main window for device/mode selection and visualizer activation.
*   **BUG FIXES & STABILITY (Audio Visualizer):**
