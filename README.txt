Thank you for downloading Akai Fire PixelForge!

** IMPORTANT: ANTIVIRUS / WINDOWS SMARTSCREEN NOTICE **
----------------------------------------------------
Because this software is from an independent developer and is not digitally signed, your antivirus or Windows SmartScreen might show a warning when you run the installer or the application.

*   **This is usually a false positive.** The application is safe if downloaded from the official GitHub Releases page.
*   **Why does this happen?** The app is bundled using standard tools (PyInstaller), and it legitimately saves your custom presets to your "My Documents" folder, which some security programs monitor closely.
*   **What to do:**
    *   On Windows SmartScreen: Click "More info," then "Run anyway."
    *   For Antivirus: Please choose to "Allow" the action or "Trust" the application.

Thank you for your understanding!

üöÄ WHAT IS AKAI FIRE PIXELFORGE?
----------------------------------------------------
PixelForge transforms your Akai Fire controller into a dynamic visual instrument.
It allows you to:
*   Paint directly onto the 4x16 RGB pads using Primary (Left-click) and Secondary (Right-click) colors.
*   NEW! Use the Audio Visualizer to turn your computer's sound into a real-time light show on the pads.
*   Create and play frame-by-frame pad animations in the "Animator Studio."
*   Use the Screen Sampler to reflect colors from your desktop onto the pads.
*   Customize the 128x64 OLED screen with custom text, images, and animated GIFs.
*   Play "LazyDOOM," a retro first-person shooter, directly on your Akai Fire's OLED!
