Thank you for downloading PixelForge for Akai Fire!

** IMPORTANT: ANTIVIRUS / WINDOWS SMARTSCREEN NOTICE **
----------------------------------------------------
Because this software is from an independent developer and is not digitally signed, your antivirus or Windows SmartScreen might show a warning when you run the installer or the application.

*   This is usually a false positive. The application is safe if downloaded from the official GitHub Releases page.
*   Why does this happen? The app is bundled using standard tools (PyInstaller), and it legitimately saves your custom presets to your "My Documents" folder, which some security programs monitor closely.
*   What to do:
    *   On Windows SmartScreen: Click "More info," then "Run anyway."
    *   For Antivirus: Please choose to "Allow" the action or "Trust" the application.

Thank you for your understanding!
